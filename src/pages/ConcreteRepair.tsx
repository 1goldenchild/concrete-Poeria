              Peoria Concrete Co. will completely rebuild and fix any chips, cracks, or broken pieces of concrete in your road, path, <Link to="/concrete-patio-peoria-il" className="text-accent hover:underline">patio</Link>, or pool deck. This will make sure that your newly fixed concrete lasts longer. On the other hand, crack fixes in concrete should be much more than just restoring the concrete. A colorful concrete overlay covering that was custom made for your home or business will definitely be useful after the job is done.

            Do the concrete floors in your home or workplace have cracks, chips, stains, or other problems that make them look bad or even dangerous? <Link to="/" className="text-accent hover:underline">Peoria Concrete Co.</Link> can help you with that. Concrete is one of the most durable and inexpensive building products you can use. However, even this cloth will show signs of wear over time. Peoria's big changes in temperature are terrible for outside concrete. Over time, freeze-thaw cycles wear down concrete in weak spots, making the surface look bad and sometimes even dangerous.

                The best way to escape the risks and structural problems that come with settling concrete is to lift it. In Peoria, the dirt is especially likely to settle, which makes concrete floors have high and low spots. Residents have had to deal with these problems for years or pay a lot of money to repair the trouble places. This problem can be fixed by a professional leveling of the concrete, which will leave your steps, roads, porches, <Link to="/concrete-patio-peoria-il" className="text-accent hover:underline">patios</Link>, and even basement floors level for a lot less money than replacing them.

                Our main job in Peoria is lifting concrete. Our polyurethane expansion foam that comes in two parts is also good for the earth. It can be used to raise concrete blocks that are falling into holes in the ground. Our method straight away levels out uneven concrete, filling in gaps below the surface and keeping loose dirt in place.

              When we get to your home, business, or other location, the first thing we'll look for is concrete that is touching. It is not possible to raise a slab that has sunk below the edge of a nearby slab or step. The block must first be brought back into place. In this case, the concrete will need to be broken up, taken away, and put down again.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              There are other, less common situations where lifting concrete is not a good idea, but these are the most common ones, and they only make up a small part of the jobs we get called for. We can get you back on steady ground quickly if your concrete isn't level or is sinking into the ground. Call us at 309-245-7421 right now!
